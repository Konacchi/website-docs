### * You can skip step 1 and 2 by just creating a new osu!.exe shortcut instead and drag it elsewhere.

## 3. Right click the newly shortcut you've just created, and press Properties

## 5. Press Apply and your Datenshi shortcut is ready to use! Run the shortcut if you want to play in Datenshi, also you can return to Bancho by just running the original osu!.exe application.

### * You might need to re-login since Bancho and Datenshi are two different servers.
