Hello! This is a guide for those who got a message from our Bot in-game. We are introducing to the public our very own unique pp limiter, this limiter's purpose is mostly to prevent an abuser/cheater to gain more pp, additional note that **if you get messaged you are not in banned/restricted state**. You are however not allowed to gain pp anymore, meaning if you play another beatmap you will get 0pp as a result in the end of the beatmap.

## Languages

## FAQ

- Q: **What if I don't use Discord?**
- A: We will not approve any other kind of inquiries other than from Discord, you should make a Discord account ![ehu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9847780/116959893-1ecbaa80-acc9-11eb-99ce-fd475b89e75c.png). Otherwise you won't be whitelisted and still won't be able to gain more PPs.
