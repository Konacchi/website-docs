Hello! this is a guide for those who got a message from our Bot in-game. We introduce you that we have a unique pp limiter, this limiter is mostly to prevent an abuser/cheater to have more pp, **please note that you are not in banned/restricted mode**. It's just that you won't get more pp, if you play another fresh beatmap you will only get 0pp.

# Limits

These limits are both applied in Relax & Vanilla.

- Total PP
  - 5000pp (STD)
  - 8888pp (Taiko) 
  - 8888pp (CTB)
  - 9999pp (mania)
- Per Score/Individual PP
  - Not so disclosed value.

\* PP limit may change in the future without any notice depending on the staff discretion.
