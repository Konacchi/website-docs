#FAQ
A few question that are frequently asked

-----------------------

- **Q: My map hasn't been ranked but it follows the criterea?**
- A: There's a chance that your map doesn't get detected by the system, you can re-request again in discord with this format : `[REQ](osu-beatmap-link)(mode)` **Only for Donaters**

-----------------------

- **Q: Why isn't my map submitted?**
- A: That can happen when : The beatmap is new, wrong beatmap link, or the beatmap database retrieval system from Datenshi to official osu! has not been updated 
- 
-----------------------

- **Q: How long does it take for my map to be ranked?**
- A: Depending on the Beatmap Nominator themselves, BN's need time to review and sort out beatmaps that follow the criteria 

-----------------------

- **Q: How many maps can I request at this time?**
- A: For now the maximum request is 4 (This might change from time to time) 

-----------------------


#### Notes
Before requesting, make sure your unranked map you are submitting are :

- In Graveyard, at least 1 month to avoid the map getting updated by the mapper (abandoned map) 
- Metadata that soothe the eyes. For example **Diao Ye Zong feat.** is bad, please avoid it.

#### Rules

1. The map must be playable and still follows the Bancho's RC. If not, it is likely to be loved. 
2. A longstream map that is easily abused is likely to be loved . (Because the majority of relax players can use the DT mod to get PP)
3. Overlapped objects, 2B maps, Storyboard based maps (Maps that require the storyboard to be turned on to be played) will be loved. 
4. Near impossible map (Galaxy Collapse, etc) those that can be passed by a player will be ranked.
5. A marathon map with a duration of more than 40 minutes (or those that hit the std score limit) will be loved. (Example: Songs Compilation by Nevo with 54 minutes)
6. Abusive PP Maps (Maps that contain only 1-2 patterns, stacking longstream high bpm (relax)) are likely to be loved. 

All maps are likely to be ranked unless the map contain features mentioned in the rules above.

#### RANKED

1. PLAYABLE, This one is a must, what it meant by playable is that it can atleast be played by a casual players (Players with average abilities and doesn't pursue skills / basically they play just to have fun) 
2. Less unecessary overstream note where the notes accumulate on a single stream, This will be manually checked.
3. Unique & Variative patterns, Not too monotonous but this is optional, we can still reconsider it.
4. METADATA like OD AR HP will be judged accordingly.

#### LOVED

1. Unique Patterns is a big plus.
2. Playable Monotone and interesting patterns (Nothing wrong with being motonous, atleast the pattern is interesting and will be pleasant to play)
3. METADATA It's not gonna be a problem here as long as it doesn't interfere with gameplay)
4. puritit. (*Single*-chunked note that can cause Auto-death will be thrown here)

#### NOTE

- Can be judged with the rules (SR will be weighted too)
- Denying any unplayable maps unless someone can pass it (Categorized as **LOVED**)
- Training map pack will be categorized as LOVED, same rule apply with osu!mania.
- Because the CTB RC is a little more flexible than the official one, charts with a Length under 5 minutes even though there are only less than 2 difficulties which are rankable, will be able to be approved if it follows the written rules above.
- Old pattern (ex. Deif maps under 2014) can be reconsidered to be ranked too.

#### RULES

1. Playable, This is a must, If its not playable then it will be thrown to loved.
2. Less 1/4+1/6, 1/6+1/8 patterns, don't have too many types of patterns like this if the map wants to be ranked, but i can be loved instead.
3. Longstream is fine, but stable, If the 1/4 or 1/6 longstream is stable, it doesn't matter, if for example 1/4 + 1/6 is still allowed as long as the 1/6 pattern is at the end of the stream, for 1/6 in the middle of the stream and continued with a 1/4 stream, it will be loved.
4. Endurance map, if the map contains a longstream and no breaks at all or more than 2 minutes of length and / or the stamina map with high bpm will be loved too. For the stamina map but bpm under 250 can still be reconsidered.
5. Mapset with speed rate difficulties is preferred to be loved.
6. Doublet spam will be loved.
7. Pattern with random slider appear or a Pattern inside the slider will be loved.
8. Spinner Spamming, If its too spammed it will unnecessarily decrease your gauge. Loved.
9. Invisible Pattern, This type of pattern usually requires Storyboard like Aspire type maps. Loved.
Note: **If it is like GOVERNMENT KNOWS**, it will be - **unranked** by default for *certain reasons*. 
10. Metadata, This will be considered if the maps will be ranked or not.
11. Trash patterns on low difficulty will be not accepted. The use of a finisher on low difficulty should be paid close attention.
