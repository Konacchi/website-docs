**Please read this till the end!!!**

Because Datenshi isn't fully capable of identifying suspicious players. We, who rely on reports from several players to be able to identify suspicious players have certain conditions that must be followed by suspected players. Players who wants to get 'Verified Tenshi' can also follow these conditions. 

These conditions must be met if you want to get the `Verified Tenshi` role. Players who have been banned/restricted in Datenshi also **must follow** these conditions to prove that you really didn't use illegal/co-op programs alike so you can get out of **banned/restricted** status, but you won't be able to get a role.
