If you tried to connect with tournament client and IRC at the same time, make sure to not leave suddenly while match is on progress, it will cause all the players with client in the room to automatically disconnect except those who connected via IRC.

## Server Address

Address = `play.datenshi.pw:6667`

## Tutorial

1. Go to our IRC Page [Here](/irc)
2. Generate new token
3. Open your IRC Client and add the server
4. Copy your token to Server Password
5. Save and Connect
6. Finish

## Notes

When network disconnection occured that sourced not originally from the server (e.g. internet constraints from the user), the messages issued to the IRC client can be duplicated.
